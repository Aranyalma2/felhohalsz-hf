## üß± Architecture

- **Backend**: Node.js (Express + EJS)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Human Detection**: DeepStack
- **Notification System**: Email
- **CD**: Docker Compose + Watchtower
- **CI**: GitHub Actions (Docker image build + push)

---

## üîÅ CI/CD Pipeline

### CI: GitHub Actions (build & push Docker image)

- Automatic steps triggered on code push:
  1. **Build**: Build the Node.js application
  2. **Lint/Test**: ESLint + Unit tests
  3. **Docker image build**: Based on Dockerfile
  4. **Docker image push**: To Docker Hub
  5. **Deploy**: Automatic deployment

### CD: Watchtower (automatic update)

Watchtower is a container that monitors other containers‚Äô images and restarts them when a new version is available.

#### Watchtower settings:

- Monitors newly published images on Docker Hub
- Downloads and restarts the container when a new image is detected

---

## üß™ Development Workflow

- GitHub workflow
- Automatic deployment from the main branch
- Feature branches
- Yarn package manager

### Data Structures Used

#### Image Storage (Image)

MongoDB [GridFS](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/gridfs/) solution (splitting due to Mongo's max record size)

Built-in `files collection` (shortened format)

```json
{
  "_id" : "_id",
  "uploadDate" : "2025-04-18T12:00:00Z",
  "filename" : "image-hash.jpg",
  "metadata" : {},
}
```

- filename: name of the uploaded file
- uploadDate: time of upload

#### Image Metadata Storage

Stored in the ```metadata``` attribute of the collection.

```json
{
  "description": "Piknik a parkban",
  "peopleDetected": 1,
  "detections": [
    {
      "x_min": 100,
      "y_min": 50,
      "x_max": 200,
      "y_max": 300
    }
  ],
  "imageUrl": "/images/_id"
}
```

- description: text description of the image
- peopleDetected: number of people detected
- detections: coordinates of the bounding boxes
- imageUrl: path to the image file

#### Subscriber

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "subscribedAt": "2025-04-18T12:00:00Z",
  "isActive": true
}
```

- email: user's email address
- subscribedAt: time of subscription
- isActive: whether the subscription is active
